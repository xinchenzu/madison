# 🧠 MarketMind  
**AI-Powered Market Research & Strategy Assistant**

🔗 **Live App:** https://marketmind-17.onrender.com/

MarketMind is a Streamlit + CrewAI market research app that generates **pricing intel, source-aware sentiment, feature benchmarking, product demand trend**, and a **final strategy report** — all written as exportable artifacts in `./outputs/` and visualized in a clean dashboard.

Built for **founders, product managers, and strategy teams** who want fast, structured market intelligence with repeatable outputs.

## 🚀 What MarketMind Does

MarketMind runs a multi-stage pipeline to generate:

- 💰 **Product + competitor pricing** → `competitor_prices.json`
- 💬 **Source-aware sentiment** (single truth used by chart + report)  
  → `sentiment_verified.json` + `review_sentiment.md`
- ⚙️ **Feature scores (0–10)** for Product vs Competitors → `feature_scores.json` (radar chart)
- 📈 **Product demand / growth trend (product-level, not generic industry CAGR)**  
  → `market_growth.json` (line chart)
- 🧾 **Executive-ready synthesis report** → `final_market_strategy_report.md`

All outputs are saved to `./outputs/` and visualized in the Streamlit UI.

## ✅ What’s New (Latest Behavior)

### 1) User-driven comparisons (no hardcoding)
Users can enter their own:
- **Competitors** (comma or newline separated)
- **Features to compare** (comma or newline separated)

These inputs are passed into `run_analysis()` and the AI generates artifacts specifically for the user’s selection.

### 2) Feature comparison table output is restored (clean “before format”)
MarketMind writes:
- `outputs/feature_comparison.md`

This report uses:
- **Real competitor names as columns** (no “Competitor A/B”)
- **ONLY user-entered features**
- **Price row patched from pricing JSON** (source of truth)

### 3) Single source of truth for sentiment (fixes mismatches)
Sentiment now writes:
- `outputs/sentiment_verified.json`  ✅ **Used by the pie chart + report**
- `outputs/review_sentiment.md` (human-readable summary)

This prevents the donut chart and markdown report from showing different sentiment.

### 4) Themes hidden by default (cleaner, less “token noise”)
`review_sentiment.md` **does not show themes by default** to keep it customer-friendly.
(Themes can be added back later as an optional toggle if needed.)

### 5) Product trend is product-specific
The growth line chart is based on **product demand trend** (product-level), not generic industry growth.
