# Appendix C — The Book Scaffold Script (`new_book.py`)

<!-- SUBJECT-SPECIFIC OPERATING FRAME: START -->

## Subject-Specific Operating Frame

This copy is specialized for this book. Use `writing-tools/figure-checker.md` as the domain anchor for expertise, examples, accuracy checks, and disciplinary judgment.

**Domain expert:** You are a history professor with expertise across historical interpretation, chronology, causation, primary sources, historiography, maps, and public history communication. Your job is to review figures submitted for a university-level history textbook and produce correction instructions that can be executed directly by a coding agent (Codex, Claude Code, or Cowork) on the source SVG files.

**Accuracy standard:** Historical accuracy: Flag wrong dates, incorrect sequence, anachronisms, misleading maps, unsupported causal arrows, missing actors, false equivalence, wrong geography, or anything contradicting the chapter.

When running this tool, adapt the generic instructions below to this subject:

- Prefer examples, metaphors, figures, and chapter structures that fit the domain expert's field.
- Treat the local accuracy standard as a hard gate before drafting, enriching, fact-checking, or approving content.
- Preserve disciplinary vocabulary, units, notation, citation norms, evidence hierarchy, and common student misconceptions for this subject.
- When a figure, table, diagram, or visual prompt is involved, apply the local `figure-checker.md` mental-model test before accepting the artifact.
- If the generic prompt below conflicts with the local subject frame, the subject frame wins.

*What `new_book.py` does and how to run it.*

---

This is the script behind Chapter 5 (*Book Scaffold*). Unlike the prompt appendices, a script is run, not pasted — and code ages faster than prose, so what follows is a usage reference. The script itself lives in the book repository at `pantry/new_book.py` (in a working setup it sits wherever you keep your tools, e.g. `~/tools/new_book.py`).

**Runs in:** a terminal (Python 3) — not Cowork or Codex; it is a script you execute.

**Dependencies:** none required. *Optional:* a `TIKTOC.md` to scaffold from (`--tiktoc TIKTOC.md`).

**Produces:** a complete book directory — planning files, `chapters/` stubs, `pantry/`, `images/`, `d3/`, `SCRIPTS/`.

---


## What it does

`new_book.py` reads nothing and asks nothing beyond its arguments. It creates a complete, empty book directory — the structural commitment your `TIKTOC.md` describes, turned into folders and stub files. Its whole purpose is to make the spec's vagueness visible: if the scaffold has a blank where a capability statement should be, the spec was blank there too.

## How to run it

```
python new_book.py "My Book Title" "Author Name"
python new_book.py "My Book Title" "Author Name" --subtitle "The Evidence Problem" --volume 1 --chapters 14
python new_book.py "My Book Title" "Author Name" --dir ~/textbooks/books
python new_book.py "My Book Title" "Author Name" --publisher "My Press"
```

**Arguments and flags:**

- `title` (required) — the working book title.
- `author` (required) — author name.
- `--subtitle` — optional subtitle.
- `--volume` — volume number for a series.
- `--chapters N` — number of chapter stubs to create.
- `--dir` — parent directory for the new book folder (defaults to the current directory).
- `--publisher` — publisher name for the copyright page.

## What it produces

```
book.md                 ← book description + high-level outline (planning)
outline.md              ← starter table of contents (planning)
vision.md               ← Tic TOC Phase 1: vision and positioning
architecture.md         ← Tic TOC Phase 2: learning architecture
chapters-spec.md        ← Tic TOC Phase 3: chapter specifications
risks.md                ← Tic TOC Phase 4: scope, market, risks
chapters/
    00-frontmatter.md   ← copyright, dedication, preface
    01-introduction.md  ← introduction
    02-chapter-01.md … NN-chapter-XX.md
    99-back-matter.md   ← acknowledgments, about the author, notes, references
pantry/                 ← fragments, snippets, research notes
images/                 ← figures as PNG (the book uses these)
d3/                     ← interactive D3 HTML versions
SCRIPTS/
```

The `vision.md`, `architecture.md`, `chapters-spec.md`, and `risks.md` files map one-to-one onto the four Tic TOC phases — the scaffold is the spec made into a directory. If those files come out thin, the spec was thin, and the fix is in Tic TOC (Appendix A), not here.
