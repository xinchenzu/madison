## Planning Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `book.md` | One-sentence pitch, the argument, the gap, the reader, high-level outline. |
| `outline.md` | Chapter-level table of contents — keep in sync with `chapters/`. |
| `vision.md` | Tic TOC Phase 1 — book concept, type, learner profile, thesis, field positioning. |
| `architecture.md` | Tic TOC Phase 2 — learning outcomes, sequencing, three-act arc, prerequisites. |
| `chapters-spec.md` | Tic TOC Phase 3 — per-chapter specs, cases, contested claims, coverage gaps. |
| `risks.md` | Tic TOC Phase 4 — comparable texts, features, out of scope, adoption risks. |
| `pantry/` | Scratch storage for fragments and snippets that don't yet belong in a chapter. |

These files are for planning only. They are not compiled into the EPUB.

The four Tic TOC files are templated with `[NEEDS HUMAN INPUT]` markers
and a `*Phase N output from Tic TOC*` header signature. Run Tic TOC's
`/scaffold silent` to fill them from `book.md`, `outline.md`, `pantry/`,
and `chapters/`. Or build them section-by-section through the interactive
phase commands (`/i1` → `/m4`).

## Chapters

| File | Title | Status |
|------|-------|--------|

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

Output goes to `output/` (gitignored).

## Figures

```bash
./graphs.sh
```

Processes `<!-- → [TYPE: description] -->` comments in every chapter:
- Tabular figures → classed markdown tables (`.infographic-table`, `.comparison-table`, `.data-table`)
- Non-tabular figures → placeholder images in `images/`, ready to replace
- CSS log appended to `styles/kindle-book.css` on each run

Review `chapters/*-updated.md`, then promote:
```bash
for f in chapters/*-updated.md; do mv "$f" "${f/-updated/}"; done
```

## Styles

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `styles/kindle.css` | Shared base — typography, figure table classes. Do not edit per book. |
| `styles/kindle-book.css` | Book-specific overrides. Edit freely. `graphs.sh` appends its log here. |

## Publish

Upload `output/madison-plus-one.epub` to [KDP](https://kdp.amazon.com).
